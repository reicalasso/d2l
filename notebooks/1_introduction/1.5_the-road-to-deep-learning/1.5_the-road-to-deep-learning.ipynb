        "The rise of deep learning was enabled by massive data availability, cheap storage, and rapid growth in computational power—especially GPUs. While memory did not scale as fast as data, computation outpaced both, favoring models that trade memory for compute. This shifted the field from linear and kernel methods toward deep neural networks and revived older ideas like MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Q-learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Progress over the last decade was driven not only by scale but also by key innovations: dropout for regularization; attention mechanisms for efficient long-range dependency modeling; and the Transformer architecture, which scales exceptionally well across modalities. Large language models gained powerful capabilities through scale and alignment. Additional advances include multi-step reasoning architectures, GANs and diffusion models for generation, large-scale distributed training, parallelized reinforcement learning, and modern frameworks that drastically lowered the barrier to building complex models."
