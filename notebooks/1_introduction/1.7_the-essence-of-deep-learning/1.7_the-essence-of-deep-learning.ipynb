        "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on multi-layer neural networks, where representations at all layers are learned jointly from data. Its key strength lies in end-to-end training, replacing manual feature engineering with automatically learned representations. This enables superior performance on raw perceptual data such as images, audio, and text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The field has shifted from parametric to nonparametric models as data and compute became abundant, accepting nonconvex optimization and empirical experimentation. While this often reduces interpretability, it has unified many domains under shared tools and accelerated progress through open-source collaboration and accessible frameworks.\n",
