        "Machine learning has delivered practical results for decades, often invisibly powering systems like fraud detection, search, recommendation, and financial decision-making. Recently, deep learning has pushed AI into the spotlight by solving previously intractable, consumer-facing problems such as speech recognition, object detection, game-playing (e.g., AlphaGo), and partial vehicle autonomy.\n",

        "While fears of artificial general intelligence and AI apocalypse are common in popular discourse, current systems remain task-specific, engineered, and goal-driven. The more urgent concerns lie in automation’s societal impact and the risks of bias and unfairness in algorithmic decision-making, rather than the emergence of sentient or malevolent superintelligence.\n",
