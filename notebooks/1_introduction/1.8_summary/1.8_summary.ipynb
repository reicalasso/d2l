        "Machine learning studies how computer systems can leverage experience (often data) toimprove performance at specific tasks. It combines ideas from statistics, data mining, andoptimization. Often, it is used as a means of implementing AI solutions. As a class ofmachine learning, representational learning focuses on how to automatically find the ap-propriate way to represent data. Considered as multi-level representation learning throughlearning many layers of transformations, deep learning replaces not only the shallow mod-els at the end of traditional machine learning pipelines, but also the labor-intensive processof feature engineering. Much of the recent progress in deep learning has been triggeredby an abundance of data arising from cheap sensors and Internet-scale applications, andby significant progress in computation, mostly through GPUs. Furthermore, the availabil-ity of efficient deep learning frameworks has made design and implementation of wholesystem optimization significantly easier, and this is a key component in obtaining highperformance.\n",
